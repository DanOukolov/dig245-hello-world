	    <u><h3>About Me:</h3></u>
	    <p>
	    	<ol>
					<li> I am taking this class because I want to learn practical programming skills.</li><br>
					<li> I have some experience making content using google sites and drag and drop programs for companies.<br>
						I did one for my family's business and for some other people. <br>
						However, I really want to learn real time data vizualization, so I can start a business I have wanted to try out when I graduate.<br>
					  I have taken CSC 121, and I am taking CSC 221 right now.</li><br>
					<li>My goal is to just learn as much as possible and make a beautiful web app that pokes at data-privacy issues. I love beautiful presentations, and I like privacy and security. So, my main goal is to just try something that blends beauty with privacy.</li><br>

			  <h5>The Command Line</h5>
				<blockquote>The command line module brought me through some of the most common commands to use when working with the cmd -- important impressions: git bash is what I need for my windows laptop, and the terminal is what I can use on the Apple desktop. Some of the commands are different across the two platforms, but the general jist is the same. The most common ones are most certainly cd, pwd, cd .., ls, ls -la, dir, mkdir, and all of the git commands. I have a feeling that I will need to refer back to this module as I found that working in the terminal can speed up my workflow if I use extended file paths in my commands. The module also covered how to run scripts through the command line which I am have yet to understand why someone would do that. </blockquote>
		    <h5>The Filesystem</h5>
				<blockquote>The filesystem was pretty straight forward and covered some of the same topics that the command line covered. It was basically the command line applied to manipulating files on your computer. It also covered specifics on how files are generally organized and structures within the computer. This included users and permissions, the paths to find the files, and the extensions given to files to tell the computer which apps can open them. Although this module was shorter than the last, I believe it might be even more useful considering how important it is to understand where all your information is kept and how it is organized. I also found the shortuts to be helpful -- although I will need some refreshers every now and then. </blockquote>

		<u><h3>Inspiration and Passions</h3></u>
			<p>Music is not my passion, but interactive and beautiful presentations are one of my love languages. This is simply a beautiful and interactive way to teach or learn. I would love to make something like this.</p>
			<a href ="https://teropa.info/loop/#/title" >How Generative Music Works</a>
			<p>I am pretty anti-surveilance so this one also speaks to me. I am a fan of Anonymous and their hacking work, but I also like the laid back vibe of this creator. He curses too, so that's cool to me as well. : )</p>
			<a href = "https://ilovechrisbaker.com/">Troll the NSA</a>
			<p>Again music is not my passion, but I am passionate about humor and presenting it well. This is <strong>FUNNY.</strong> Not only is the site beautiful, it's also very personal. The AI roasts they used on me were not only specific, but they were extremely creative. They made jokes about the different blends of music genres I listen to and how they blended horribly. Amazing project right here.</p>

	<!-- I would not say that this assignment was hard but it was definitely time consuming. It makes me appreciate all of the work that goes into the web apps we use. My software engineering friends say that their companies give them wrapper functions to do a lot of this stuff, but still. There is a lot here!
One thing that I was confused on is that we were supposed to change the file index.html, but there was no file called that. Only html.html or hello.html. I hope I made the right change. Nevermind, I found the issue.-->
